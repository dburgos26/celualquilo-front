## Run the project
To run the project, you need to have npm installed. Then, you can run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm start
```
Which will initiate a development server. If npm start fails, either npm is not installed or most likely react-scripts are missing. The latter can be solved with:

```bash
npm install react-scripts
```

Remember to install the necessary dependencies
